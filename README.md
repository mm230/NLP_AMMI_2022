# NLP Lab1 Week1

## part I:
- Naive Bayes:
The goal of this lab is to implement a language identifier (LID).
Our first model will be based on Naive Bayes.

## Part II:
- Logistic regression
In this second part of the lab, we will implement a language identifier trained on the same data, but using Logistic Regression instead of Naive Bayes.
